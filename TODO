TODO: Stuff that needs to be done
Urgent:
1. Remove shitty build.sh and use a proper build system.
2. Remove useless comments
3. Don't USE redundant typecasts
4. Proper whitespacing
5. Remove 'r3x_' prefix from source files
6. Make typecasting mechanism local.
7. Print errors to stderr not to stdout.
8. 'fopen' returns null on not just file ceasing to exits. Add a proper message
9. Stop using different case styles, use either normal_case, CamelCase, or cameCase.
10. Use something like a debug macro, to fix nt_malloc_init
11. Stop using swear words.
12. Stop using multiple printfs
13. Fix identation
14. Remove useless 'else' statements
15. Remove offensive error messages (Keep it down)
16. Use a standard header for endianess (<endian.h>), remove big_endian.h
17. Write standard-compliant code.
18. Rewrite include guards, to not use reserved prefixes.
19. Rewrite big_endian.h to use <byteswap.h>
20. Remove all references to R3X_BIG_ENDIAN, and use a common function to read a 32-bit integer from memory.
21. Show message for big endian machines too. Use a common function to read as above.
22. Remove the little malloc wrapper. It's problematic.
23. Remove /fasm/ directory and use git's submodule system to link it to fasm's repository.
24. Use strdup() instead of manually using malloc to create duplicate of strings
25. Remove useless binaries from /src/ directory.
26. Use the current directory, (and not the executable directory) for devenv.
27. Don't use strncmp for comparision, since it works without error on things like ("helpppppppp" instead of showing an error message)
28. Update "r3x_version.h" to simply have 1 name for all architectures, use standard functions to detect system rather than manually specifying it.
29. Improve code overall, try to make it more readable, at the same time run with decent performance.
30. Exit on not receiving arguments --> Fixed.
Thanks to guys at #osdev for these suggestions!
