<h2>BASIC</h2>
An implementation of TinBASIC is the only HLL language which is ported to R3X VM.
<h3>Let's begin with a "Hello, World!"</h3>
<pre>
	REM This is a comment
	REM Print Hello, world to screen
	PRINT "Hello, World!"
	REM Exit.
	END
</pre>
Using a text editor, save this file as "hello.bas", and run tbc, with the following:<br>
tbc hello.bas > hello.asm<br>
Now it should generate an assembler file, however if you use FASM to compile it, it gives an error:<br>
<pre>
fasm: 'include/libR3X.pkg' not found.
</pre>
You need the "libR3X.pkg" and the "r3x_asm.pkg", in an "include" directory, which should be where you generate your progrmas.<br>
Then use:<br>
<pre>fasm hello.asm</pre>
This should generate a "hello.exe" file, run the program using:<br>
<pre>
rxvm -exe ./hello.exe
</pre>
You should see the words "Hello, World!" on the output screen. If you press a key, then the program will exit.<br>
<h3>Integers</h3>
Unfortunately, as of it's current state, TinyBASIC for R3X doesn't support strings (even C-like strings!). The only<br>
available type is an integer, what's worse is that the only integer names which can be used are A-Z. Hence, there can only be 26 total<br>
integers in all. This limitation is being worked on.<br>
To get started let's know about the "LET" keyword:<br>
<pre>
REM Set X to 23 / 5
LET X = 20 / 5
REM Y = 4 now
LET Y = (X/2)+5
REM Print Y
PRINT "Y is : "; Y
END
</pre>
<h3>Getting to know keywords</h3>
The <b>IF</b> keyword:<br>
<pre>
...
IF A+1 [ = > < >= <=] Y+2 GOTO 20
</pre>
