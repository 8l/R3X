<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<pre>
The BIOS is the first thing that is loaded and executed by the REX virtual machine. It is a separate program with a fixed size of 512 bytes<br>
located in /executable_directory/bios/bios,bin as defined by the standard. It is loaded at address 0 and has an implementation defined format<br>
(binary for the offical implementation).<br>
Although what the BIOS actually does is totally based upon the implementation, however there is one special requirement that a REX BIOS<br>
needs to adhere to, it is giving the program system information through interrupt 0x20.<br>
A REX BIOS is supposed to register interrupt 0x20, when a program calls interrupt 0x20, the handler<br> is supposed to:<br>
1. Push the REX CPU ID to normal stack
2. Push the BIOS ID to normal stack 
3. Push the IS_UNIX flag to normal stack (1 = System running on a UNIX-compliant OS / 2 = Running on a non-standard OS)
...and return to code without changing the value of ANY registers and without modifying the call stack.
