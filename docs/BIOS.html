<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<pre>
The BIOS is the first thing that is loaded and executed by the REX virtual machine. It is a separate program with a fixed size of 512 bytes<br>
located in /executable_directory/bios/bios,bin as defined by the standard. It is loaded at address 0 and has an implementation defined format<br>
(binary for the offical implementation).<br>

The BIOS is the part of the main thread, and hence is responsible for executing the application. The CPU passes the address of the application's<br>
init in register R0. The BIOS is supposed to jump to this address, and NOT modify the value of R0.<br>

The BIOS provides a function known as 'sysinfo', which is installed at interrupt 0x20, calling this interrupt would<br>
push the system information values in the following order:<br>
MACHINE_VER - Version of the CPU
BIOS_VER - Version of the BIOS 
IS_UNIX - Running on a UNIX-Complaint operating system (0=no, any non-zero value = yes)
