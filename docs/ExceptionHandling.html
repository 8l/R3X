<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
Exception Handling in the REX architecture is in it's very early stages, however<br>
it is fully functional.<br>
<h3>Kinds of exceptions</h3>
As of now, there are 3 types of exceptions that can be handled, they are given below<br>
INVALID_ACCESS - Invalid Memory Access<br>
INVALID_OPCODE - Invalid Instruction <br>
R_EXCEP - Program defined exception <br>
<h3>Handling Exceptions</h3>
Exceptions can be handled by assigning them with specific handlers, using the "catch" instruction.<br>
Example Usage: <br>
<pre>
push handler_address
push R_EXCEP/INVALID_ACCESS/INVALID_OPCODE --- Exception ID
catch
popn 2 ; Optional but recommended
</pre>
<h3>Throwing custom exceptions</h3>
The INVALID_ACCESS/INVALID_OPCODE exceptions are caused when a program does an invalid memory access or<br>
executes an unknown instruction. But there are a third type of exception as shown above: "R_EXCEP"<br>
The 'throw' instruction is used to intentionally cause an exception. Example usage show below:<br>
<pre>
push error_code
push R_EXCEP
throw
</pre>
One advice would be to 'pop' out the exception ID at the start of the handler, which would make the error_code at the top of stack.<br>
An example is shown in src/programs/exception.asm
