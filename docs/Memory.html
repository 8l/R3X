<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<pre>
When it comes to virtual machines, memory is the first thing that needs to be take care of. Under the REX architecture, 
memory can be accessed using several instructions. More information found on the "CPU Instructions" page.

Since REX is currently a primitive CPU there is <b>no</b> support for virtual memory, and hence all addresses
accessed by the CPU are physical. It would be useful to note however, that the CPU does provide protection against
malicious programs which attempt to access memory outside the allocated region.
</pre>
<h3>Stack</h3>
<pre>
At the core of the REX architecture, lies the stack, a memory region containing data, <i>pushed</i> onto by the program.
The stack is the single unit being responsible for storing data required for arithmetic operations, 
system calls, memory operations and so on. Since REX is a more of a stack-based machine (but it does have registers), the
stack is a very important aspect of the CPU, and hence direct access to the stack is prohibited. The stack <b>does not</b>
lie within the application memory. Access to the stack can be done using several instructions: push, pop, pushr, popr, loads etc.
Please see the "CPU Instructions" page about what instructions are used to access the stack.

The REX CPU uses a totally different stack for return addresses, this ensures that the return address is not corrupted
throughout simple operations which forget to pop out values. Please do note that it is a bad pratice to not pop out used 
data after use on the stack, and it wastes memory.
</pre>
<h3>Reserved Memory</h3>
<pre>
The REX architecture reserves all memory under the program load point, and access memory below is considered undefined behaviour. The program load point is implementation defined, however all implementations are <b>required</b> to define
the constant <b><i>R3_LOAD_POINT</i></b> as the load address.

Also, the first 512-bytes are reserved globally, regardless of the implementation, the first 512-bytes MUST be reserved
for the system BIOS.
