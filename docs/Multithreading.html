<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>Multithreading</h2>
The REX CPU supports multithreading through the CPU Dispatcher which dispatches jobs to the CPU's Root Domain.<br>
The CPU's root domain is made up of sub-domains which contain threading information<br>
To dispatch a job to a sub-domain, simply do: (libR3X):<br>
<pre>System.DispatchJob job
...
job:
	loadr R0, value
	code here...

</pre>
To exit from a job, use System.Quit, (note that the exit instruction works differently for the "main" domain and other domains, when the main<br>
domain exits all sub-domains are closed, but when a sub-domain exits, no modification is done to the other domains<br>
Planned support for pausing, and exitting tasks from the main domain..<br>
