<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>Native Linking</h2>
REX programs are written in byte code, but can also use native code if required, through shared objects.<br>
This is known as native linking.<br>
The disadvantage of native linking is that the library needs to be rewritten/recompiled for a new platform.<br>
Please note that native linking is an experimental feature, and can be subject to changes in future<br>
<h1>Writing a shared library</h1>
First, get a copy of "virtual-machine.h" and "stack.o" located in src/programs/rex.<br>
Then compile r3x_stack.c to an object file.<br>
Then write your library like this:<br>
<pre>
#include "rex/virtual-machine.h"
r3x_cpu_t* CPUptr = NULL;
void Start(r3x_cpu_t* CPU) {
	CPUptr = CPU;
}
...
</pre>
Having a start function is mandatory, this will save your CPU pointer which the VM passes, now you can<br>
use this pointer to do operations on the CPU when your function is called.<br>
Compile the library using:<br>
<pre>
gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic mylib.c -o mylib.o
gcc -shared -o mylib.so mylib.o stack.o [The object file given in src/programs/rex/] -lc -lm
</pre>
Then in your program, load the library like this:<br>
<pre>
pushstring "mylib.so"
loadlib
</pre>
Execute functions, like this:<br>
<pre>
pushstring "mylib.so"
pushstring "myfunction"
libexec
</pre>
An example is given in /src/programs/mylib.c and /src/programs/nativelib.il<br>
(Note that on Windows systems the extension is usually .DLL.)<br>
</pre>
