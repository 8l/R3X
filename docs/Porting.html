<h2>Porting the R3X Virtual Machine</h2>
As a program that makes use of multithreading, OpenGL and dynamic linking, R3X may<br>
seem to require a lot of dependencies, but this can be minimized.<br>
There are a few defines which can change the course of compilation, here is<br>
a small list of them:<br>
<pre>REX_GRAPHICS</pre>
Defines whether to use SDL/OpenGL libraries, note that compilations without using<br>
this would have problems with user input. This bug is currently being fixed.<br>
<pre>R_DEBUG</pre>
