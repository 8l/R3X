<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>REX Calling Convention</h2>
The REX Calling convention is the standard convention by which REX programs are supposed to communicate<br>
to external / internal methods. <br>

For arguments the convention uses the data stack of a domain, the arguments are to be push in ascending order, <br>
that is, the first argument is pushed first, the second is pushed second, and so on.<br>

For this mechanism to work properly, the caller MUST know the total number of arguments to be given to the method.<br>

Next, the caller must increment the stack pointer by 4, by pushing 4 registers to the data stack. They can be any 4 out of the 20 registers provided<br>
This is used to preserve registers during the call.<br>

The return value from the function is stored in R7.<br>
An example is given below (in assembly):<br>
<pre>
	push 1
	push 2
	push 3
	; Push 4 items to stack.
	; They can be regs as well, if you want to save their values
	push 0
	push 0
	push 0
	push 0
	
	call add3numbers
	
	popn 4
	; Pop out the number of args on stack
	popn 3
	...
function add3numbers
	; load first argument from stack
	loadr R8, 4+3
	loadsr R8
	loadr R7, R8
	; Load second argument from stack
	loadr R8, 4+2
	loadsr R8
	addrr R7, R8
	; Load third argument from stack
	loadr R8, 4+1
	loadsr R8
	addr R7, R8
	; Return
	ret
	...
</pre>
