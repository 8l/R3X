<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>Syscalls</h2>
The <b>syscall</b> instruction is provided by the CPU, however what it means is totally implementation defined.<br>
Due to this, REX programs will have huge problems while running on different implementations, to solve this problem<br>
the standard defines 9 system calls which need to be present in every implementation. <br>
The following system calls are to be defined in every implementation which conforms to the REX standard.<br>
<b><i>SYSCALL_PUTCH</i></b> - Print an 8-bit ASCII character pushed to stack to stdout or any other graphics device assumed to be stdout<br>
<b><i>SYSCALL_PUTS</i></b> - Print an unformatted string to program's stdout or any other graphics device which is assumed to be stdout.<br>
<b><i>SYSCALL_PUTI/SYSCALL_PUTF</i></b> - Print an integer/float pushed to stack to stdout or any other graphics device assumed to be stdout<br>
<b><i>SYSCALL_GETC</i></b> - Get a character from stdout.<br>
<b><i>SYSCALL_ATOI</i></b> - Convert string which is pointed by the last value pushed to stack, and push the converted value to stack. <br>
<b><i>SYSCALL_ALLOC</b></i> - Allocate memory, size should be pushed on stack. No longer than 4096 bytes must be allocated at once, This ensures that allocations are not erroneous.<br>
<b><i>SYSCALL_FOPEN, SYSCALL_FREAD, SYSCALL_FWRITE</i></b> - Planned, not there in offical implementation yet. <br>
