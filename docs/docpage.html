<h1>R3X VM online documentation</h1>
Welcome to the R3X Online Documentation page! There is not much to see here yet, because this
site is under construction. Like it or not, till now, most of the documentation is available in the
docs/ directory of the github repository.<br><br>

Now you may observe that the documentation in the repository is very unorganised, and that is exactly
what we are fixing here. Therefore, this is bound to take some time.

However, there are still a few pages, that might be of your interest here and are complete:
<ul>
<li type="disc"><a href="./building.html">Building the R3X runtime</a></li>
<li type="disc"><a href="./options.html">Virtual Machine command line options</a></li>
<li type="disc"><a href="./compiler.html">Compiler Command Line options</a></li>
<li type="disc"><a href="./t++.html">T++ programming language documentation</a></li>
<li type="disc"><a href="./rstdlib.html">R3X Standard Library for T++ documentation (rstdlib)</a></li>
</ul>
</html>
