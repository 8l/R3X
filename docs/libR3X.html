<h2>libR3X - REX Standard Library</h2>
libR3X is a library provided by the offical REX CPU implementation, it contains useful macro instructions and defines that can used by the<br>
program.<br>
The current implementation provides the following functions:<br>
<pre>
<b>Console.Write "String"</b> - Writes an unformatted string to stdout or graphics device assumed to be stdout.
<b>Console.NewLine</b> - Writes a newline character to stdout or graphics device assumed to be stdout.
<b>Console.WriteFloat</b> - Writes an IEEE754 floating point number pushed on stack to stdout or graphics device assumed to be stdout.
<b>Console.WriteInt</b> - Writes a 32-bit integer pushed on stack to stdout or graphics device assumed to be stdout.
<b>Console.WritePointer addr</b> - Write an unformatted string pointer by "addr", to stdout or graphics device assumed to be stdout.
<b>Console.WaitKey</b> - Waits for keypress and returns.
<b>Console.GetInput size, addr</b> - Get input from console into string pointed by "addr", with size "size".
<b>Memcpy dest, src, len</b> - Copies a chunk of memory.
<b>MemcpyR</b> - Copies a chunck of memory but uses registers. R0 = dest, R1 = src, R2 = len
<b>Stack.Push, Stack,Pop, Stack.PushRegister, Stack.PopRegister</b> - Class based push, pop, pushr and popr functions.
<b>StoreInt addr, int | StoreByte addr, byte</b> Stores an 8/32-bit value in "int" to address pointed by "addr"
