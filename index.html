<h1>R3X Virtual Machine</h1>
<div>R3X is an experiment to rebuild an entire runtime environment from scratch. The project began in the 
November of 2014, as a hobbyist's attempt at studying virtual machines. Since then, the project has moved 
quite ahead, and is very functional. There is indeed quite a lot of complications and technical errors, 
but it is improving. The <i>runtime environment</i> features a debugger, a fully capable instruction set, 
a standard library, a compiler and a small terminal emulator which uses OpenGL capabilities.</div>
