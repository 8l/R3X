TBC+ - TinyBasic+ for R3X
TBC+ is a small extended version of the TinyBASIC programming language. It is designed to run
on R3X systems.
I'd like to give credit to the original creator by providing the link to the original repository: https://github.com/Luiji/TinyBASIC-C
Language:
	TBC+ is very similar to TinyBASIC and other BASIC-based languages, however there are certain differences.
	
Keywords:

	Use a 0xFFFFFF to use hexadecimal notation. (A,B,C,D,E,F digits should be in caps)
	Use a 0b101010101 for binary notation
	Use a 0o01234567 for octal notation
	
	PRINT "STR"; EXPRESSION - Print a string to the terminal, or an integer which is a result of EXPRESSION as described.
	INPUT <INT> - Input an integer from the terminal
	ALLOC <INT> = EXPRESSION - Allocate bytes of memory given by expression and store address in <INT>.
	LET [A-Z] = EXPRESSION - Set a variable (A-Z Only), to the value of EXPRESSION
	PTR [A-Z] = EXPRESSION - Set a variable (A-Z Only). to the 32-bit value at the addressof(value of EXPRESSION)
	ASM "<asm code>" - Output the assembler code directly
	IF EXPRESSION [> < = >= <=] EXPRESSION GOTO/GOTO INT/LABEL - Jump to a line number / label if condition is true.
	LABEL label name - Declare a label
	GOTO - Goto a line number / label
	GOSUB - Goto a line number / label, and push return address to stack
	RETURN - Return to the address pushed to call stack
	WHILE EXPRESSION [> < = >= <=] EXPRESSION - Do a while loop (max 256 nestings allowed)
	ENDW - End while
Labels:
	Labels can be created like this:
	  label mylabel
	...And can be used like this,
		goto mylabel
		gosub mylabel
	Unfortunately, you currently cannot refer to the address of labels as of now, nor can you
	currently pass an expression to goto or gosub.
Arrays:
	Currently array support is limited.
	Creating an array:
		alloc S = 256 --- Allocate 256 bytes for S.
		[S] = 'A'  -> 8-bit assignment
		@S@ = 0x41 -> 16-bit assignment
		{S} = 0x41 -> 32-bit assignment
		[S+1] = 0
		LET X = [S] // X = 'A' or 65.
	Also, {S} will load a 32-bit integer, [S] will load an 8-bit integer, and @S@ will load a 16-bit integer.
Operators:
	Current supported operators are +, -, /, *, %, &, ^, |. There is operator precendence, but it's very shitty.
	Please don't use it, instead just use fkn parentheses, and if you can't then go fuck yourself, I don't
	have time for this shit.
	
	Thank you. And fuck off, please goto the line 61 to see what it means...
	... OMFG WTF RECURSION??!?!?! RECURSION IS SUPPORTED YAY! [to an extent]

Using variables in inline asm:
	The address to variables can be referred to as v0 [for variable A]. v1 [for variable B] and so on..
	You're free to use these addresses to modify variables in inline asm. Yes, you're free the fuck with
	whatever you want, just dont come to me.

Usage:
	./tbc file.bas > output.asm
	fasm output.asm
P.S. While compiling with FASM you will need an 'libR3X.pkg' and 'r3x_asm.pkg' which are in src/programs/libR3X.

-----Uh, this document is badly written, I'll write a better version when I've more time on my hands.-----
